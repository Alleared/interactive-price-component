Frontend Mentor JavaScript Junior challenge. I'm having more trouble with CSS than JavaScript in the last projects, even though I want to practice JavaScript more. It was especially hard to make the background colors of the range input change between the thumb. I used javascript to change the color, but is there a easy way to do it with CSS only?
Any feedback on that or anything else, it'd be much appreciated. Thanks!
